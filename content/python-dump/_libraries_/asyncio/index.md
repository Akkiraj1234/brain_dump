`asyncio` is a Python library used to write **concurrent code** using the `async` and `await` keywords. It's built around the concept of an **event loop**, allowing you to run multiple I/O-bound operations *asynchronously* within a single thread.

---

## üìö How to Study Asyncio?

There are two approaches to learning `asyncio`, depending on your goals:

1. **High-Level** ‚Äì For writing async applications (‚úÖ we will focus on this)  
2. [**Low-Level**](#Ô∏è-low-level) ‚Äì For building async libraries or contributing to the `asyncio` internals (‚ùå not covered here)
3. [**async programming Intro**](./defination.md) ‚Äì For learning how to use async tools in real life code how to deal with stuff

> We will only cover **High-Level APIs**, as they are enough to build robust async applications.  
> If you're building low-level frameworks or libraries, check the official docs for Low-Level APIs.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Low-level APIs are not recommended for general async app development.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è [Low-Level](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio)

> You don't need this for normal async apps.  \
> These are useful only if you're building **low-level libraries** or working deep with the **event loop**.  \
> (Think: framework developers or advanced contributors.)


- [**Intro**]():  
  A short intro to low-level stuff ‚Äî written by me (Akki).
- [**Event Loop**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html):  
  This is the heart of asyncio. It runs tasks, callbacks, handles network stuff, subprocesses ‚Äî everything.  
- [**Futures**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html):  
  Futures are like promises ‚Äî they represent a value that‚Äôs coming later. Used to connect old-style async code with `await`.  
- [**Transports and Protocols**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html):  
  For high-performance stuff (like building your own HTTP server). Uses callback-style instead of async/await.  
- [**Policies**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-policy.html):  
  Lets you customize how event loops are created ‚Äî useful when you're messing with threads or want special behavior.  
- [**Platform Support**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-platforms.html):  
  Asyncio works on most systems, but some things (like event loops) behave differently on Windows, Linux, etc.  
- [**Extending asyncio**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-extending.html):  
  If you're building your own event loop or deep extension, this helps. You probably won‚Äôt need it ‚Äî but it's there.
