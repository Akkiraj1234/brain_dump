- ~~**Decorators**: Creating and applying `decorators`.~~
- ~~**File Handling**: Reading/writing files, working `with` binary files.~~
- ~~**Iterators and Generators**: `iter()`, `next()`, `yield` usage.~~
- ~~**Testing**: unittest basics, pytest.~~
- ~~**String Formatting**: `f-strings`, `.format()`, old-style formatting (%).~~

-
- ~~**Built-in Modules**: os, shutil, subprocess, math, etc.~~
- ~~**Basic GUI Development**: tkinter and PyQt.~~
- ~~**Networking with Requests**: Basic HTTP requests, API calls.~~
- ~~**Web Scraping**: Using BeautifulSoup and Scrapy for extracting data from web pages.~~
- ~~**CLI Application Development**: Building command-line tools using libraries like argparse and click.~~
- ~~**Regular Expressions (Regex)**: Using the re module for pattern matching.~~
- **Modules and Packages**: Building and using your own modules/packages.
